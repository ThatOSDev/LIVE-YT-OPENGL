# LIVE-YT-OPENGL
This is the github for the Live YT Channel video  
  
YTOPENGL is for building the library  
  
YT_TEST_OPENGL is for testing the library that we create  
  
NOTE : This simple library demonstration, shows that you can create a raylib "like" library all written in C. A logger is included. OpenGL is implemented, however all the functions are not there, as they have not been written yet. With that in mind though, they can be added to your liking since GLAD is now functioning. So you can make your own rectangles and text or anything else you want, by using this demonstration as a foundation.
